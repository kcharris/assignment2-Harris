### Soccer  
I like **soccer** because a few of my favorite characters from shows that I like enjoy it. **They kick** a ball around a field and I guess that's pretty cool. The playing field is technically bigger than a football field so it has that going for it.

# Code Snippet and quote

~~~
I just got started with Markdown. I love it, but there is one thing bugging me: How can I change the size of an image using Markdown?

The documentation only gives the following suggestion for an image:

![drawing](drawing.jpg)
If it is possible I would like the picture to also be centered. I am asking for general Markdown, not just how GitHub does it.

Checkerboard pattern SVG snippet. <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/svg-patterns/>
```
<svg width="100%" height="100%">
    
  <!-- Let's define the pattern -->
  <!-- The width and height should be double the size of a single checker -->
  <pattern id="pattern-checkers" x="0" y="0" width="200" height="200" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
    <!-- Two instances of the same checker, only positioned apart on the `x` and `y` axis -->
    <!-- We will define the `fill` in the CSS for flexible use -->
    <rect class="checker" x="0" width="100" height="100" y="0"></rect>
    <rect class="checker" x="100" width="100" height="100" y="100"></rect>
  </pattern>
  
  <!-- Define the shape that will contain our pattern as the fill -->
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#pattern-checkers)"></rect>
  
</svg>
